    square their in (e.g. 0 and 1 for the 1st EX on the HW). The flag will be on the same row as the duck that is allowed to 
    (the one with the cap). Use 'T' as a means to show that there was an energy swap followed by '->' symbolizing who received it. 
    This is what should be coded within the Duck and DuckState classes. Be sure to make toString methods!
